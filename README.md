*I'm a **Software QA** with over 6 years of experience in IT.*

*Several years ago I tried to learn the **Java language** for later use in Automation testing and I've got it. After my first Automation testing courses, I couldn't find projects to realize obtained the knowledge gained . I've created some small projects with Automation tests to avoiding my manual routines.*

*Also, I've had experience in **TypeScript**. I've created Page Objects, Page Elements worked with docker for running our tests in containers, and azure - for creating deploy scripts.*

The major question is **Why do I want to learn Automated Testing?**. 
These are a few thoughts about it:

 - Improving new knowledge in the programing language, newest applications and technologies.
 - Ð¡losely working with the development team.
 - I get automation regression testing out of the way so I can focus on the fun stuff.
 - Automating testing helps reduce time and effort for regression and other routine testing operation.
